Hello there! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dgur1) advised by [Jonathan Katz](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/). In 2019, I got my M.Sc. from New Jersey Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Kurt Rohloff](https://web.njit.edu/~rohloff/) (and unofficially [Yuriy Polyakov](https://ypolyakov.gitlab.io/)).

I work on lattice multiparty protocols. That is any protocol that includes multiple interacting parties with their own private data and utilizes lattice based primitives. I am also interested in threshold cryptography, oblivious pseudorandom functions, homomorphic encryption, digital signatures and lattice/post quantum cryptography and secure multiparty computation in general.

Previously I was a PQC research scientist resident at SandboxAQ under the supervision of [Martin Albrecht](https://malb.io/).

Name FAQ
------
* "How do I pronounce your name?"
  
  It's pronounced as Doe-Rook but call me Derek if it's easier.

* "I thought your name was Kamil, why don't you use that?"

  My actual name is Doruk, most of the time Turkish first names are ``pre-names" that work similar to middle names/initials.

* "What about the Ã¼ in your last name?"
  
  If your language allows that, that is the actual letter in my surname. If not, Gur is fine.

* **2024-12-19**: I finally caved and created this webpage (I can neither deny nor confirm the graduation approaching had an effect). Thank you [AcademicPages](https://academicpages.github.io/) for making this process easy.
